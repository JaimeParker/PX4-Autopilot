/**
 * @file RateControllerWrapper.hpp
 *
 * Standalone wrapper for PX4 rate controller.
 * Provides a clean interface for use in RL environments.
 *
 * Replicates the gain-scaling and yaw LPF post-processing from
 * PX4's MulticopterRateControl module without any middleware.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The angular_accel input (D-term) must be provided by the
 * simulation environment. In PX4, this comes from the gyro pipeline.
 * For RL use, compute it as finite-difference of angular velocity
 * or from the physics engine's analytic derivative.
